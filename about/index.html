		<p> A Culinary Odyssey Across Continents

    In a world where borders blur, four passionate individuals from Ethiopia, Ireland, Lebanon, and Hong Kong found a common language in their love for food. United by a shared dream, we embarked on a culinary odyssey to create a restaurant that mirrors our unique backgrounds.

    Our diverse team brings together the authenticity of traditional Ethiopian dishes, the hearty comfort of Irish favorites, the aromatic delights of Lebanese cuisine, and the bold flavors of Hong Kong street food. Culinary Concoctions isn't just a restaurant; it's a celebration of cultural diversity served on a plate.</p>

  <p> Meet the Team:</p>

   <p> -Gelila Getu from Ethiopia brings the soulful spices and rich history of East African cuisine.<p/>
